#12.7 LAB: Fat-burning heart rate

#Write a program that calculates an adult's fat-burning heart rate, which is 70% of the difference between 220 
#and the person's age respectively. Complete fat_burning_heart_rate() to calculate the fat burning heart rate.

#The adult's age must be between the ages of 18 and 75 inclusive. If the age entered is not in this range, raise 
#a ValueError exception in get_age() with the message "Invalid age." Handle the exception in __main__ and print 
#the ValueError message along with "Could not calculate heart rate info."
